# Truckfly Frontend Interview

## Goal

Your goal is to build a js app that will display gifs that the Giphy API returns for "truck", using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

The app should have 2 main screens: 
 - a list of the most recent gifs for "truck", fetched from the Giphy API
 - a detail view of one gif, showing the gif in a bigger size and the name of the gif

The list screen should have a button to refresh the list.


## Build instructions

You are free to do it the way you want! We recommend using the great [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
